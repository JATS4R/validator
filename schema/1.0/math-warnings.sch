      WARNING: All
      mathematical expressions should be provided in markup using either &lt;mml:math&gt; or
      &lt;tex-math&gt;. The only instance in which the graphic representation of a mathematical
      expression should be used outside of &lt;alternatives> and without the equivalent markup is
      where that expression is so complicated that it cannot be represented in markup at all.
